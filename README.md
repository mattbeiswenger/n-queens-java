# Installation
The N-queens puzzle is the problem of placing the maximum number of queens on a chess chess board of any given size so that no two queens can attack one another.
To run the JavaFX application, clone or download the project files. Navigate to the ```dist``` folder and open the ```.jar``` file.
If Java 7 or above is installed on your system, then a JavaFX GUI interface should appear asking for the size of the board. Enter one number where the number specifies a board of n*n size. I would suggest using a number no larger than 12 as the visualization does not resize due to JavaFx's limitations. Then, simply press enter.
